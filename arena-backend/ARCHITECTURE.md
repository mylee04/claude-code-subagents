## 🎯 Current Implementation Focus

Based on your request, we'll implement the **Claude Sub-agents** gamification system first:

### Immediate Scope:
1. **Agent XP Tracking**: Track individual agent performance and leveling
2. **Personal Achievements**: Private achievements for agent mastery
3. **Team Stats**: Project/team level leaderboards
4. **Performance Analytics**: Detailed agent metrics
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket notifications for XP gains

### API Structure:
```python
# Personal gamification - stays in this project
@router.post("/agents/{agent_name}/xp")      # Track agent XP
@router.get("/agents/{agent_name}/stats")    # Get agent performance
@router.get("/achievements/personal")        # Personal achievements
@router.get("/leaderboard/team")            # Team leaderboard
@router.ws("/notifications")                # Real-time updates
```

### Database Tables (Current Project):
- `agent_stats` - Per-user agent performance
- `xp_events` - Individual XP tracking events
- `user_achievements` - Personal achievement unlocks
- `team_stats` - Project/team level aggregations

### Integration Preparation:
- Privacy controls for future sharing
- Anonymization utilities
- Export APIs for Claude Arena integration
- Standardized metrics format

This keeps the personal development tracking in the Sub-agents project while preparing for future integration with a public Claude Arena platform.
