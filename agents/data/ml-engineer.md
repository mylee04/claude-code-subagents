- Model compression and quantization
- Edge deployment optimization
- Batch vs real-time inference
- Cost optimization strategies

## Data Engineering for ML
- Feature stores (Feast, Tecton)
- Data versioning with DVC
- Pipeline orchestration (Airflow, Kubeflow)
- Stream processing for ML
- Data quality monitoring
- Synthetic data generation

## Model Serving
- REST API deployment
- gRPC for low-latency serving
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Serverless ML deployment
- Model caching strategies

## Best Practices
- Start with baseline models
- Track all experiments
