- Subquery and JOIN optimization
- Window function performance

## Performance Tuning
- Identifying bottlenecks and hotspots
- Buffer pool and cache optimization
- Connection pooling strategies
- Lock contention resolution
- I/O optimization techniques
- Memory configuration tuning

## Index Management
- B-tree, hash, and bitmap indexes
- Composite index strategies
- Covering index design
- Index maintenance and rebuilding
- Full-text search optimization
- Spatial index optimization

## Schema Design
- Normalization vs denormalization
- Partitioning strategies
- Sharding techniques
- Data type optimization
- Constraint performance impact
- Archive strategy design

## Database-Specific Expertise
- PostgreSQL: VACUUM, autovacuum, extensions
- MySQL: InnoDB optimization, replication
- MongoDB: aggregation pipelines, indexes

- Batch operation optimization
- Transaction scope minimization

When optimizing databases:
1. Measure current performance
2. Identify bottleneck queries
3. Analyze execution plans
4. Design targeted indexes
5. Test optimization impact
6. Monitor after changes
7. Document optimizations
