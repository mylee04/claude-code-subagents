## 🚀 Overview

The Claude Code Agent Collection is a curated set of specialized AI agents designed to enhance your development workflow. Unlike traditional static tools, this collection features a dynamic system that assembles a custom AI development team tailored to your specific project needs.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Dynamic Team Assembly**: The `agent-assembler` reads your project's `claude.md` file and generates new custom agents tailored to your tech stack
- **🤝 Agent Orchestration**: The `feature-planner` and other conductor agents coordinate existing specialists to handle complex tasks
- **📁 Organized by Domain**: Agents are categorized for easy discovery and use
- **🔧 Extensible**: Easy to add new agents or customize existing ones

### 🎼 Two Types of Conductor Agents

1. **Agent Creators** (e.g., `agent-assembler`): Generate new agent files customized for your specific project needs
2. **Agent Orchestrators** (e.g., `feature-planner`): Coordinate existing agents to work together on complex tasks

   - Maintain high code quality and test coverage
   ```

## 🎨 Agent Management Approaches

There are two ways to manage agents in Claude Code:

### 1. Global/Personal Agents (via this repository)
These are general-purpose agents installed to `~/.claude/agents/` that are available across all your projects:

```bash
# Install all agents globally
./install.sh
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Available in any project
- ✅ Shared collection of battle-tested agents
- ✅ Easy bulk installation

**Use for:**
- Common development tasks (git, testing, code review)
- General-purpose agents you use frequently
- Base agents that work across different tech stacks

### 2. Project-Specific Agents (via /agents command)
These are custom agents created for specific projects:

```bash
# In Claude Code, use:
/agents → Create new agent
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Registered with Claude Code (works with Task tool)
- ✅ Project-specific knowledge and conventions
- ✅ Generated by agent-assembler for your exact tech stack

**Use for:**
- Agents generated by `/agent-assembler`
- Project-specific conventions and workflows
- Tech stack-specific agents (e.g., `nextjs-app-router-expert`)

💡 **Important**: Agents created by copying files directly to `~/.claude/agents/` won't work with the Task tool. Always use the `/agents` command to properly register project-specific agents.

### 📖 How to Use the Agents

#### Method 1: Using Slash Commands (Recommended)
Once agents are installed in `~/.claude/agents/`, you can use them with slash commands:

```bash
# Generate custom agents for your project
/agent-assembler

# Plan a complex feature
/feature-planner Implement real-time metrics dashboard

# Use specific agents directly
/backend-architect Design the database schema for datasets
/frontend-developer Create the user dashboard component
/security-auditor Review authentication implementation
```

#### Method 2: Using Natural Language
If slash commands aren't working, you can invoke agents naturally:

```
Use the agent-assembler to analyze my claude.md and create custom agents
```

#### Method 3: Using the Task Tool
For more complex operations:

```
Use the feature-planner agent to design a user authentication system
```

### 🎯 Typical Workflow

1. **First, generate project-specific agents**:
   ```
   /agent-assembler
   ```
   This reads your `claude.md` and creates custom agents like `react-specialist` or `postgres-expert`

2. **Then, use conductor agents for complex tasks**:
   ```
   /feature-planner Build a real-time chat feature
   ```

3. **Or use specialist agents directly**:
   ```
   /database-optimizer Analyze and improve query performance
   ```

### ✅ What Happens Next?

After running `/agent-assembler`, you'll receive:
1. **Agent definitions** for your specific tech stack (e.g., `react-typescript-specialist`, `supabase-backend-specialist`)
2. **Instructions** to add each agent via the `/agents` command
3. **Ready-to-use content** for each custom agent

To use your generated agents:
```bash
# 1. Run agent-assembler
/agent-assembler

# 2. For each generated agent:
/agents → Create new agent → Paste the content

# 3. Now use your custom agents!
/react-typescript-specialist Build a data dashboard
```

💡 **Pro tip**: The agent-assembler creates agents tailored to YOUR project's specific tech stack, coding standards, and goals from your `claude.md` file!

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Initial Setup - Agent Generation
The `agent-assembler` reads your `claude.md` file and:
- Analyzes your technology stack and project needs
- Generates new custom agent files specific to your project
- Places them in your `~/.claude/agents/` directory
- Creates agents like `react-specialist` or `postgres-expert` based on your stack

### 2. Task Execution - Agent Orchestration
When you need to accomplish complex tasks:
- Use conductor agents like `feature-planner` to coordinate work
- The conductor invokes relevant specialist agents
- Each specialist handles their domain (backend, frontend, security, etc.)
- Results are synthesized into a cohesive solution

### 3. Collaborative Workflow
The two-layer system ensures:
- You have the right agents for your specific project (via generation)
- Those agents work together effectively (via orchestration)
- Complex tasks are broken down and distributed properly
- No duplicate effort or gaps in coverage

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate Custom Agents for Your Project
When you run `/agent-assembler`, it analyzes your `claude.md` and creates project-specific agents:

```
/agent-assembler
```

### 🎯 Best Practices for Agent Organization

**For Global Agents:**
- Keep general-purpose agents that work across projects
- Avoid project-specific naming or configurations
- Focus on reusable, technology-agnostic capabilities

**For Project-Specific Agents:**
- Store in project directories (e.g., `.claude/agents/` in your project)
- Name with project prefixes to avoid conflicts
- Include project-specific conventions and standards
- Register via `/agents` command for Task tool compatibility

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Install this collection globally for base capabilities
2. Run `/agent-assembler` in each project for custom agents
3. Keep project agents separate from global collection

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Add New Agents**: Create new agents following our template
2. **Improve Existing Agents**: Enhance prompts and capabilities
3. **Share Use Cases**: Document your workflows and examples
4. **Report Issues**: Help us improve the collection

### Creating a New Agent

1. Choose the appropriate category folder
2. Create a markdown file with frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: your-agent-name
   description: Brief description of what this agent does
   ---
   
   You are the "Agent Name," a specialist in...
   ```

3. Submit a pull request with your agent

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Slash commands not working?
1. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/agents/
   ```
   You should see all the agent `.md` files

2. **Check agent format**:
   - Ensure agents have proper frontmatter with `name:` and `description:`
   - Agent names should match the slash command exactly

3. **Alternative invocation methods**:
   - Natural language: "Use the agent-assembler to..."
   - Task tool: Select the Task tool and specify the agent
   - Direct reference: "@agent-assembler please..."

### Task Tool Not Finding Your Agent?

**Problem**: Agent exists in `~/.claude/agents/` but Task tool says "agent not found"

**Solution**: The agent needs to be registered via `/agents` command:
1. Type `/agents` in Claude Code
2. Select "Create new agent"
3. Copy your agent content and save
4. Now the Task tool will recognize it

**Why this happens**: 
- File-based agents (copied to disk) ≠ Registered agents (added via `/agents`)
- Only registered agents work with the Task tool
- Global agents from this repo work via direct slash commands

### Common Issues

**"Directory does not exist" error**:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
```

**"Agent not found" error**:
- For slash commands: Verify the agent file exists in `~/.claude/agents/`
- For Task tool: Ensure agent is registered via `/agents` command
- Try reinstalling: `cp agents/conductor/agent-assembler.md ~/.claude/agents/`

## 💭 Philosophy

### The Right Tool for the Job
We believe every project deserves a custom-tailored AI team. Generic solutions lead to generic results.

### Collaborative Intelligence
Complex problems require multiple perspectives. Our agents work together, just like a real development team.

### Continuous Evolution
As Claude Code evolves, so does this collection. We're constantly adding new agents and improving existing ones.
