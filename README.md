## 🚀 Overview

The Claude Code Agent Collection is a curated set of specialized AI agents designed to enhance your development workflow. Unlike traditional static tools, this collection features a dynamic system that assembles a custom AI development team tailored to your specific project needs.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Dynamic Team Assembly**: The `agent-assembler` reads your project's `claude.md` file and generates new custom agents tailored to your tech stack
- **🤝 Agent Orchestration**: The `feature-planner` and other conductor agents coordinate existing specialists to handle complex tasks
- **📁 Organized by Domain**: Agents are categorized for easy discovery and use
- **🔧 Extensible**: Easy to add new agents or customize existing ones

### 🎼 Two Types of Conductor Agents

1. **Agent Creators** (e.g., `agent-assembler`): Generate new agent files customized for your specific project needs
2. **Agent Orchestrators** (e.g., `feature-planner`): Coordinate existing agents to work together on complex tasks

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed and configured
- A project with a `claude.md` file describing your tech stack and goals

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mylee04/claude-code-subagents.git
   cd claude-code-subagents
   ```

2. **Install the agents**:
   ```bash
   # Run the installation script
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   # Create Claude's agent directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
   
   # Copy all agents to Claude Code
   cp -r agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

3. **In your project, create a `claude.md` file**:
   ```markdown
   # Project: My Awesome App
   
   ## Tech Stack
   - Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
   - Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
   - Infrastructure: AWS, Docker
   
   ## Goals
   - Build a scalable SaaS platform
   - Maintain high code quality and test coverage
   ```

## 🎨 Agent Management Approaches

There are two ways to manage agents in Claude Code:

### 1. Global/Personal Agents (via this repository)
These are general-purpose agents installed to `~/.claude/agents/` that are available across all your projects:

```bash
# Install all agents globally
./install.sh
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Available in any project
- ✅ Shared collection of battle-tested agents
- ✅ Easy bulk installation

**Use for:**
- Common development tasks (git, testing, code review)
- General-purpose agents you use frequently
- Base agents that work across different tech stacks

### 2. Project-Specific Agents (via /agents command)
These are custom agents created for specific projects:

```bash
# In Claude Code, use:
/agents → Create new agent
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatically recognized when using proper YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Works with Task tool when formatted correctly
- ✅ Project-specific knowledge and conventions
- ✅ Generated by agent-assembler for your exact tech stack

**Use for:**
- Agents generated by `/agent-assembler`
- Project-specific conventions and workflows
- Tech stack-specific agents (e.g., `nextjs-app-router-expert`)

💡 **Important**: Agents MUST have proper YAML frontmatter to work with the Task tool and appear in `/agents` command, regardless of how they're created.

## 🎨 Visual Agent Indicators

Claude Code uses visual cues to show agent status:

### ✅ Agents with Correct YAML Frontmatter
![Agent with colored background](docs/images/registered-agent-colored.png)
- **Colored background badges** (orange, blue, etc.)
- Have proper YAML frontmatter format
- Work with both slash commands and Task tool
- Show in `/agents` command list
- Can be organized into "Personal" or "Project" sections

### ❌ Agents with Incorrect Format (Missing YAML Frontmatter)
![Agents without YAML frontmatter](docs/images/file-based-agents.png)
- **Blue arrow icons** without colored backgrounds
- Missing required YAML frontmatter at the top of the file
- Don't appear in `/agents` command list
- Won't work with Task tool
- **Easy fix**: Just add the YAML frontmatter!

### 📁 Project Agents Location
Project agents can be stored in `.claude/agents/` within your project directory. To make them show in the "Project agents" section with proper colors:

1. Create `.claude/agents/` directory in your project
2. Add `.md` files with proper YAML frontmatter
3. Agents automatically appear under "Project agents" in `/agents`
4. You'll see the colored background indicating proper format

## 🔑 CRITICAL: Agent File Format Requirement

**BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY!** Agents MUST have YAML frontmatter to be recognized by Claude Code!

### ✅ Correct Format (Works with /agents)
```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Brief description of what this agent does
color: blue  # optional: blue, green, yellow, red, purple, cyan, orange
---

You are the Agent Name, a specialist in...
```

### ❌ Incorrect Format (Won't be recognized)
```markdown
# Your Agent Name

You are a specialist in...
```

Without the YAML frontmatter:
- ❌ Agent won't appear in `/agents` command
- ❌ Can't be used with Task tool
- ❌ Won't have colored background badge
- ❌ Not recognized by Claude Code due to missing format

**The Fix**: Simply add the YAML frontmatter to any `.md` file in `.claude/agents/` and it will automatically appear in the `/agents` list!

### 📸 Visual Proof

**Before**: Agents without YAML frontmatter (not recognized)
![Agents not showing in /agents command](docs/images/agents-not-recognized.png)

**After**: Same agents with YAML frontmatter added
![All agents now showing in /agents command](docs/images/agents-recognized.png)

Notice how all 6 claude-arena agents now appear in the "Project agents" section!

### 📖 How to Use the Agents

#### Method 1: Using Slash Commands (Recommended)
Once agents are installed in `~/.claude/agents/`, you can use them with slash commands:

```bash
# Generate custom agents for your project
/agent-assembler

# Plan a complex feature
/feature-planner Implement real-time metrics dashboard

# Use specific agents directly
/backend-architect Design the database schema for datasets
/frontend-developer Create the user dashboard component
/security-auditor Review authentication implementation
```

#### Method 2: Using Natural Language
If slash commands aren't working, you can invoke agents naturally:

```
Use the agent-assembler to analyze my claude.md and create custom agents
```

#### Method 3: Using the Task Tool
For more complex operations:

```
Use the feature-planner agent to design a user authentication system
```

### 🎯 Typical Workflow

1. **First, generate project-specific agents**:
   ```
   /agent-assembler
   ```
   This reads your `claude.md` and creates custom agents like `react-specialist` or `postgres-expert`

2. **Then, use conductor agents for complex tasks**:
   ```
   /feature-planner Build a real-time chat feature
   ```

3. **Or use specialist agents directly**:
   ```
   /database-optimizer Analyze and improve query performance
   ```

### ✅ What Happens Next?

After running `/agent-assembler`, you'll receive:
1. **Agent definitions** for your specific tech stack (e.g., `react-typescript-specialist`, `supabase-backend-specialist`)
2. **Instructions** to add each agent via the `/agents` command
3. **Ready-to-use content** for each custom agent

To use your generated agents:
```bash
# 1. Run agent-assembler
/agent-assembler

# 2. For each generated agent:
/agents → Create new agent → Paste the content

# 3. Now use your custom agents!
/react-typescript-specialist Build a data dashboard
```

### 🏷️ Creating Project-Specific Agents

For agents to appear in the "Project agents" section with proper colors:

1. **Create project agents directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/agents
   ```

2. **Add agent files with YAML frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: project-agent-name
   description: Description of your project agent
   color: blue  # optional
   ---
   
   You are a specialist for this project...
   ```

3. **Result**:
   - Agent automatically shows under "Project agents (.claude/agents)"
   - Has colored background (orange, blue, etc.)
   - Works with Task tool immediately
   - Only available when in that project

💡 **Pro tip**: The agent-assembler creates agents tailored to YOUR project's specific tech stack, coding standards, and goals from your `claude.md` file!

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Initial Setup - Agent Generation
The `agent-assembler` reads your `claude.md` file and:
- Analyzes your technology stack and project needs
- Generates new custom agent files specific to your project
- Places them in your `~/.claude/agents/` directory
- Creates agents like `react-specialist` or `postgres-expert` based on your stack

### 2. Task Execution - Agent Orchestration
When you need to accomplish complex tasks:
- Use conductor agents like `feature-planner` to coordinate work
- The conductor invokes relevant specialist agents
- Each specialist handles their domain (backend, frontend, security, etc.)
- Results are synthesized into a cohesive solution

### 3. Collaborative Workflow
The two-layer system ensures:
- You have the right agents for your specific project (via generation)
- Those agents work together effectively (via orchestration)
- Complex tasks are broken down and distributed properly
- No duplicate effort or gaps in coverage

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate Custom Agents for Your Project
When you run `/agent-assembler`, it analyzes your `claude.md` and creates project-specific agents:

```
/agent-assembler
```

### 🎯 Best Practices for Agent Organization

**For Global Agents:**
- Keep general-purpose agents that work across projects
- Avoid project-specific naming or configurations
- Focus on reusable, technology-agnostic capabilities

**For Project-Specific Agents:**
- Store in project directories (e.g., `.claude/agents/` in your project)
- Name with project prefixes to avoid conflicts
- Include project-specific conventions and standards
- Always include YAML frontmatter for Task tool compatibility

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Install this collection globally for base capabilities
2. Run `/agent-assembler` in each project for custom agents
3. Keep project agents separate from global collection

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Add New Agents**: Create new agents following our template
2. **Improve Existing Agents**: Enhance prompts and capabilities
3. **Share Use Cases**: Document your workflows and examples
4. **Report Issues**: Help us improve the collection

### Creating a New Agent

1. Choose the appropriate category folder
2. Create a markdown file with **REQUIRED YAML frontmatter**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: your-agent-name
   description: Brief description of what this agent does
   color: blue  # optional: blue, green, yellow, red, purple, cyan, orange
   ---
   
   You are the "Agent Name," a specialist in...
   ```

3. **CRITICAL**: The YAML frontmatter is REQUIRED for:
   - Agent to appear in `/agents` command
   - Working with Task tool
   - Getting colored background badge
   - Proper Claude Code integration

4. **Make the agent visible in `/agents` command**:
   ```bash
   # After creating the agent file, run the install script
   ./install.sh
   
   # This copies all agents to ~/.claude/agents/ where Claude Code can find them
   ```

5. Submit a pull request with your agent

### 🎯 Quick Guide: Adding and Using New Agents

When you add a new agent to this collection:

1. **Create the agent file** in the appropriate category folder (e.g., `agents/product/your-new-agent.md`)
2. **Include YAML frontmatter** at the top of the file
3. **Run the install script** to make it visible:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
4. **Verify in Claude Code**:
   - Type `/agents` - your new agent should appear in the list
   - Use it with a slash command: `/your-new-agent`

The install script copies agents from this repository to `~/.claude/agents/`, which is where Claude Code looks for available agents.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Slash commands not working?
1. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/agents/
   ```
   You should see all the agent `.md` files

2. **Check agent format**:
   - Ensure agents have proper frontmatter with `name:` and `description:`
   - Agent names should match the slash command exactly

3. **Alternative invocation methods**:
   - Natural language: "Use the agent-assembler to..."
   - Task tool: Select the Task tool and specify the agent
   - Direct reference: "@agent-assembler please..."

### Task Tool Not Finding Your Agent?

**Problem**: Agent exists in `~/.claude/agents/` but Task tool says "agent not found"

**Solution**: Check if the agent has proper YAML frontmatter!
```yaml
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Brief description
---
```

Once you add the YAML frontmatter to the top of the `.md` file, the Task tool will immediately recognize it!

**Why this happens**: 
- Agents without YAML frontmatter aren't recognized by Claude Code
- Only agents with proper YAML frontmatter work with the Task tool
- The format is what matters, not how they were created

### Agents in `.claude/agents/` Not Showing in `/agents` Command?

**Problem**: You have `.md` files in `.claude/agents/` but they don't appear when you type `/agents`

**Solution**: Check the YAML frontmatter!
```bash
# Check if your agent has the required frontmatter
head -n 5 ~/.claude/agents/your-agent.md
```

If it's missing the YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Agent description
---
```

Add it to the top of the file, and the agent will immediately appear in `/agents`!

### Common Issues

**"Directory does not exist" error**:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
```

**"Agent not found" error**:
- Check YAML frontmatter format is correct
- Verify the agent file exists in `~/.claude/agents/` or `.claude/agents/`
- For Task tool: Ensure agent has proper YAML frontmatter
- Agent name in frontmatter must match the slash command exactly

## 💭 Philosophy

### The Right Tool for the Job
We believe every project deserves a custom-tailored AI team. Generic solutions lead to generic results.

### Collaborative Intelligence
Complex problems require multiple perspectives. Our agents work together, just like a real development team.

### Continuous Evolution
As Claude Code evolves, so does this collection. We're constantly adding new agents and improving existing ones.
