## What Is This?

A **gamified collection of 31 specialized AI agents** that work together like a development team. Each agent levels up as you use them, unlocks achievements, and forms powerful combinations for complex tasks.

**Core Value**: Instead of one generic AI assistant, you get a specialized squad where each agent is an expert in their domain (Python, DevOps, Security, etc.).

## Key Features

- **31 Specialist Agents** - From Python experts to security auditors
- **Gamification System** - Agents gain XP, level up (Recruit ‚Üí Elite), earn achievements
- **Project DNA Scanner** - Automatically generates custom agents for your tech stack
- **Team Formations** - Agents work together with synergy bonuses
- **Real Progress Tracking** - Watch your AI squad collaborate in real-time

## Interactive Demo

Try it now - see the XP system, achievements, and agent collaboration in action:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/agents && python3 gamification/scripts/squad-demo.py
```

Watch agents level up, earn achievements like "Speed Demon" and "Bug Hunter", and see real-time mission progress.

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate custom agents for your project
/agent-assembler

# Use specific agents
/python-pro optimize this function

<summary><strong>üß¨ Project DNA Scanner (Advanced)</strong></summary>

The **agent-assembler** analyzes your `claude.md` file and creates specialized agents for your exact tech stack:

```bash
/agent-assembler
# Scans your project ‚Üí Creates custom agents like:
# - react-typescript-specialist  
# - supabase-backend-expert
# - tailwind-ui-designer
```

**Why This Matters**: Instead of generic responses, you get agents that know your specific frameworks, coding standards, and architecture patterns.

**Example Output**:
```

<summary><strong>üîß Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

### Slash Commands Not Working?
1. **Check installation**: `ls ~/.claude/agents/` should show agent files
2. **Verify agent format**: Agents need YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: agent-name
   description: Agent description
   ---
   ```
3. **Alternative methods**: Use natural language ("Use python-pro to...") or Task tool

### Agents Not Appearing in `/agents`?
**Problem**: Files exist but don't show in command list  
**Solution**: Add YAML frontmatter to the top of each `.md` file

### Task Tool Says "Agent Not Found"?
**Cause**: Missing YAML frontmatter  
**Fix**: Add the required YAML header and the agent will work immediately

<summary><strong>ü§ù Contributing</strong></summary>

### Adding New Agents
1. Create `.md` file in appropriate category folder
2. **REQUIRED**: Include YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-agent-name
   description: Brief description
   color: blue  # optional
   ---
   ```
3. Run `./install.sh` to make agent available
4. Submit pull request

### Areas We Need
- Mobile Development (Swift, Kotlin, React Native)
- Game Development (Unity, Unreal Engine)  
- Blockchain (Solidity, Web3)
- Domain-specific experts (Healthcare, Finance, E-commerce)
